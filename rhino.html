    <p id=firstp> <b>Rhinos</b> once roamed many places throughout Eurasia and Africa and were known to early Europeans who depicted them in cave paintings. At the beginning of the 20th century, 500,000 rhinos roamed Africa and Asia. But today very few rhinos survive outside national parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over many decades. Two species of rhino in Asia<b>—Javan and Sumatran—</b>are critically endangered. A subspecies of the Javan rhino was declared extinct in Vietnam in 2011. A small population of the Javan rhino still clings for survival on the Indonesian island of Java. Successful conservation efforts have helped the third Asian species, the greater one-horned (or Indian) rhino, to increase in number. Their status was changed from Endangered to Vulnerable, but the species is still poached for its horn.</p>

    <h2> What exactly is a Rhino?</h2>
    <p> Rhinoceroses are large, herbivorous mammals identified by their characteristic horned snouts. The word "rhinoceros" comes from the Greek "rhino" (nose) and "ceros" (horn). There are five species and 11 subspecies of rhino; some have two horns, while others have one.

Because the animals' horns are used in folk medicine for their supposed healing properties, rhinos have been hunted nearly to extinction. Their horns are sometimes sold as trophies or decorations, but more often they are ground up and used in traditional Chinese medicine. The powder is often added to food or brewed in a tea in the belief that the horns are a powerful aphrodisiac, a hangover cure and treatment for fever, rheumatism, gout and other disorders, according to the <a href= "https://support.worldwildlife.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12623&12623.donation=form1&s_src=AWE1800OQ18494A01430RX&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3NeCut6V3wIVxYqzCh2zIQAhEAAYASAAEgJtPfD_BwE">International Rhino Foundation.</a></p>

    <p>Poaching, driven by consumer demand for rhino horn primarily in Asia, poses the biggest threat to rhinos. Most of these horns find their way into the illegal market in Vietnam, where criminal networks grind up the horns for use in traditional medicines or sell them as a high-value gift item. China is an important consumer market as well, where rhino horn enters art and antique markets and is sometimes acquired as an investment purchase.

As the growing middle class in both China and Vietnam become more affluent and can afford the high cost of rhino horn, they are driving up the demand on the international black market. Rhino poaching levels hit record highs in 2015, with <b>poachers slaughtering at least 1,300 rhinos in Africa </b>.</p>
